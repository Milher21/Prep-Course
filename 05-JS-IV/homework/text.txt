	* Objetos
        Es una forma de representar de manera individual a una cosa u objeto de nuestra vida real, for instance, we could be represented
        as an object. const Me = {name: "yourname", lastName: "yourLastName", comer: function(food){...}, 
        dormir: function(hours){...} ... }.

	* Propiedades
        Una propiedad is a characteristic that we had, and it's related to an especific object. For example, 
        the object could be a dog, and one of its properties could be color which value may be Red LOL. 

	* Métodos
        An method is a function, activity or task that an object do, i.e. if a car is our object we could say that
        one method that it has is move, accelerate, and some of them need something to be done. To turn on the ventilator
        the motor needs to exceed an determinated temperature, so this method receive the temperature and after being 
        evaluated the ventilator takes an action.

	* Bucle `for…in`
        Is a way of iterate very useful when we don't know the number of iterations that needs to be done, diffrently to
        for loop it just requires to paraments, the first one is an string that refers to an collection's element, second
        it requires an collection where the element move. Finally, we code some lines inside.

	* Notación de puntos vs notación de corchetes
    They have the same porpuse, indicate or take values from the object. In mi opinion, the first one is easier to apply.
